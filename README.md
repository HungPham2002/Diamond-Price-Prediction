# Diamond-Price-Prediction
Hello, this is a mini project which made to learn and comprehend Application of Linear Regression.
##
I approached to problem in 2 ways: Using theory of Linear Regression and Using Framework Scikitlearn (Linear_model)
Both of them have a similar weights and fit line.
##
Additionally, I have built an App by using Streamlit to deploy the trained model to predict diamond price. Of course it's just only to learn and basically understand how Machine learning models is deployded in real life.
## Thank you
